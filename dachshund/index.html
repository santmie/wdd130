            <div class="history">
                <p class = "msg1">The dachshund breed standard originated in Germany in the early 1600s. These dogs were bred to hunt burrow-dwelling animals like badgers. The word Dachshund means “badger dog”. However, these dogs were also used to hunt much larger animals like wild boars.
                    <br><br>Their low and long bodies, floppy ears, and long tails make these dogs ideally shaped to their subterranean hunting role. The dachshund was deliberately bred to have these features. Early dachshunds actually had longer legs and shorter ears. As the breed was standardized, Dachshund took the odd and cute shape they have today.
                    <br><br>The miniature dachshund appeared letter on in the 1800s and was used to chase and hunt smaller dwelling animals like rabbits. In the USA the dachshund breed has been used to hunt prairie dogs. Although today dachshunds are more commonly known raised to be house dogs, most dachshunds still retain their hunting instinct.
                    <br><br>Dachshunds were originally available in two coat types: smooth and longhaired. The wirehaired appeared later, likely, as a result of outcrossing with a terrier breed to achieve a stronger wired coat. Dachshunds are also called Dackels and Teckels in Germany and other countries.
