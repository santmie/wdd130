    <h2>Cris</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Crisanta Advincula, and I am from the Philippines. 
        <p>Listening to music is something I enjoy, particularly while I'm working. It has a calming effect 
        on my mind and aids me in concentrating and generating ideas.</p>
        <p>As a data analyst, I find my work enjoyable, but I also have a great interest in exploring 
            into the world of computer and web programming. I express my gratitude to the BYU Pathway 
            program for leading me towards this course. I am confident that the skills I will acquire from 
            this course will greatly enhance my proficiency in managing data-driven projects and presenting 
            them in a user-friendly tool for our business partners. I am excited about the knowledge I will 
            gain throughout this course.</p>
            <p>change</p>
